Pervious concrete is a tailored-property concrete with high water permeability which allow the passage of water to flow through easily through the existing interconnected large pore structure. This paper reports the results of an experimental investigation into the development of pervious concrete with reduced cement content and recycled concrete aggregate for sustainable permeable pavement construction. High fineness ground granulated blast furnace slag was used to replace up to 70 % cement by weight. The properties of the pervious concrete were evaluated by determining the compressive strength at 7 and 28 days, void content and water permeability under falling head. The compressive strength of pervious concrete increased with a reduction in the maximum aggregate size from 20 to 13 mm. The relationship between 28-day compressive strength and porosity for pervious concrete was adversely affected by the use of recycled concrete aggregate instead of natural aggregate
